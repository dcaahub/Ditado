Brexit: PM meets Euro leaders
The British Prime Minister David Cameron will face European leaders at an emergency meeting in Brussels shortly for the first time since Britain voted to leave the EU.
The leaders of Germany, France and Italy have said there will be no talks on Britain's future relationship with the EU until the government in London triggers the formal legal mechanism to leave.
